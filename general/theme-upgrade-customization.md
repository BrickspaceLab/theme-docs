# Theme Upgrade & Customization Tips

Upgrading Paper, Keystone, or Space? Make sure to:
- Review changes to header, navigation, and color settings
- If menu, accent, or background colors look off, manually re-assign your 'Accent 1' in the updated theme settings
- For custom code, test every page before publishing
- After major upgrades (v5 to v8), configuration for menus and page sections may reset
- See [menu troubleshooting](menu-troubleshooting.md)

For extra theme tweaks (rounded boxes, hiding collection names), see the relevant themeâ€™s documentation (Keystone, Paper, or Space folders above).
