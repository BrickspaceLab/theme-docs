# Adding custom CSS

Custom CSS can be applied to your Shopify theme by using the built-in [custom CSS](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/extend/add-css) feature in your theme editor. For advanced users who have more experience with development, you can use our development toolkits. Using Custom CSS through the theme editor will maintain your themes original code - this means you'll still be able to update the theme easily.
