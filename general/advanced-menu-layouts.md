# Advanced Menu Layouts

Our themes support horizontal (mega menu) and vertical menus. Paper and Keystone have flexible header menu options.

To create a mega menu:
- In Theme Editor, set Header > Menu Layout to horizontal
- Add two or more columns and menu cards (for images, descriptions)
- Use 'Show as mega menu' toggle for Paper/Keystone
- To fix menu reverting to vertical, make sure top-level menu items have children assigned

Troubleshooting: If your mega menu won't display, double check your nesting and that you've saved changes. Some upgrades (6.x â†’ 8.x or on Paper/Keystone) may reset your menu settings.
