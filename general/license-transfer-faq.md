# Theme License Transfer FAQ

**Q: Can I transfer my theme license to a different store?**
- Yes, you can transfer a purchased theme license to a new Shopify store you own. Remove the theme from your old store, then install and publish it on your new store from the Shopify Theme Store or your theme file.
- If you get a license or activation error, contact [support](https://brickspacelab.com/pages/contact) for help.

**Q: What happens to customizations during a license transfer?**
- Custom code and settings do not automatically transfer. Download your theme files and make note of customizations before transferring.

**Q: Are there limits on the number of transfers?**
- Each theme license is valid for a single Shopify store at a time. Multiple transfers are allowed but only one live store per license.
