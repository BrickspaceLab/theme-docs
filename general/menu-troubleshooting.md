# Menu & Menu Drawer Troubleshooting

If you're having problems with the menu or menu drawer (for example: doesn't open/close, won't display correctly on the homepage, mega menu layout not appearing), try these steps:

1. Clear your browser cache and test in incognito mode.
2. Confirm that JavaScript is enabled and no third-party app disables menu features.
3. After theme upgrades, review header and menu settings: Mega menu, columns, cards, and vertical/horizontal layouts can reset to defaults.
4. If the issue only happens on the home page (but not other pages), save and republish your header configuration. A fresh theme install may be needed to troubleshoot further.
5. Still stuck? [Contact support](contact-support.md) with a description and screenshots.

Paper/Keystone: Mega menus require specific column/card configuration. [Read our advanced menu guide](advanced-menu-layouts.md).
