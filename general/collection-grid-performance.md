# Optimizing Collection Grid Performance

If your collection/product grid is slow to load or seems to freeze, especially with collections with many variants/images:

- Check 'Show variants table' in your product or collection settings—disabling this can substantially speed up DOM load time
- Limit the number of visible products per page (e.g. 24)
- Theme loads images for all variants—if you have >10 images per product, this adds up fast
- Try disabling "load more" pagination if it makes load speeds worse
