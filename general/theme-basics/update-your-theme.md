# Update your theme

Our themes are updated regularly with new features, general improvements, and bug fixes.&#x20;

Your theme will automatically update for minor fixes. Unfortunetly, Shopify does not automatically update themes for major updates or when you've made customizations to the theme code. If the code has been edited, you can install updates manually or [hire an expert](../support/hire-a-shopify-developer.md) for assistance.

Visit the Shopify help center to [learn more about updating themes](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/managing-themes/updating-themes).

<details>

<summary>How do I check what theme version I’m using?</summary>

<summary>How do I check which theme version is the latest?</summary>

To confirm you are using the latest version, please refer to the Shopify theme store to reference the most recent released version. You can also find a notice in your Shopify dashboard that will highlight when a theme has a new version available. This can be seen when you navigate to **Online Store > Themes**.

<summary>How important is it to update to the latest version?</summary>

Update your theme is not a requirement. If you see we’ve released new features you’d like to take advantage of then updating would be the best option. It is generally a good idea to update to the latest version at least once a year - this way you get new features, improved performance and bug fixes.
