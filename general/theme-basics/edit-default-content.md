# Edit default content

When setting up your Shopify theme you may come across text content that can't be edited from the theme editor. Here's where the default content editor comes in handy.

To edit default content in your Shopify theme, go to **Online Store > Themes**, click the **three dots** next to your theme, and select **Edit default theme content**. Then, find the text you want to change using the tabs or search bar, edit it, and click **Save**.&#x20;

Editing default content is not possible while using a theme trial.

Default content can also be edited by using apps such as **Translate and adapt** and many other translation apps.

{% hint style="info" %}
Be careful not to change text inside curly brackets `{{ }}` or HTML link tags `<a href="">` and `</a>` as this can break the theme's functionality.&#x20;

* **Search bar**
  * Use the "Filter items" search bar to locate specific phrases or words you want to change.&#x20;
* **Edit the text**
  * Click on the tab or category that includes the text you want to change and edit the text in the available fields.&#x20;

  * To remove default text, replace it with a single space.&#x20;
