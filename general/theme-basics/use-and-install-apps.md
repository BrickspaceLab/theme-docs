# Use and install apps

Shopify apps are a fundamental part of most ecommerce sites. With over 8,000 Shopify apps it's important to understand the best approaches to take when installing apps.

Visit the Shopify help center to learn how to [extend your theme with apps](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/extend/apps).



### Considerations when using Shopify apps

* Consider building app functionality into theme by hiring a developer. This approach is recommended because many apps have the potential to impact your site's performance. You'll also avoid paying monthly fees for a single feature.
* Look for apps with the [Built for Shopify badge](https://www.shopify.com/ca/partners/blog/built-for-shopify). Apps that have this badge meet higher standards and follow best-practices for theme integration.
* Install apps using [app blocks or app embeds](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/extend/apps).
* For themes that require code changes you should try using the Custom liquid section instead of making changes directly to theme code. Taking this approach will ensure your theme can be updated much easier.
