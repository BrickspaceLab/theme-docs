# Theme license

You can get a theme license by buying a theme through the Shopify theme store. Each theme license is valid only for the store it was purchased. If you've downloaded a theme from outside the Shopify theme store or imported one into a different store, it's unlicensed.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Using an unlicensed theme may lead to a DMCA takedown from Shopify resulting in your store being taken offline without notice.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
