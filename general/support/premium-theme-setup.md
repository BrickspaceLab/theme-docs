**What is a Shopify theme setup?**\
Our Shopify theme setup is a premium service we offer. Our team will go in and set up your theme using best practices to bring your brand to life.

**Can't I just do this myself?**\
Absolutely! If you're comfortable with Shopify's platform and have the time to customize your theme, you can certainly do it yourself.

To get started, we’ll need access to your Shopify store (via staff account permissions) and any brand assets (logos, colors, fonts, product images, etc.). The more details you provide about your vision, the better we can tailor the setup to match your brand!

**What themes do you offer setups for?**\
We specialize in setting up both free and premium Shopify themes, including Dawn, Debut, Impulse, and many others. If you have a specific theme in mind, just let us know—we’re happy to work with it!
