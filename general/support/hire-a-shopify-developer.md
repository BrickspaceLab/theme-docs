### When to hire a Shopify developer <a href="#h_0170420437" id="h_0170420437"></a>

When customizing your Shopify store, it's best to start with built-in features and settings before resorting to code changes. However, there are times when working with a developer or learning to code becomes necessary. Here's what you need to know:

1. Explore no-code options first Try to achieve your desired features or design elements using Shopify's built-in tools and app integrations before considering code modifications.
2. Consider hiring a Shopify expert If you've exhausted no-code options and are unfamiliar with coding, it's time to work with an expert.
