# Account drawer

### Section overview

This section is responsible for rendering and managing the account drawer functionality which includes login forms, customer account information, orders, addresses, and customizable content blocks.

#### Common use cases

* Providing customers with access to their account information, orders, and addresses
* Creating personalized login/signup experiences for different user states
* Adding custom content and announcements visible only to specific customer segments
* Integrating B2B functionality with company locations and permissions

#### Usage tips

* Customize the color schemes to match your store's branding
* Use content blocks with different visibility settings to create personalized experiences
* Consider mobile responsiveness as the account drawer adapts differently on mobile (bottom drawer) vs desktop (right drawer)
* Avoid adding too many content blocks as this can make the account drawer feel cluttered

{% hint style="info" %}
**Version requirement:** Custom account and login URLs are available in Keystone theme version 2.0.1 or later.
{% endhint %}

#### Custom account URL

You can specify a custom URL for account pages in **Theme Settings > Account**. This is helpful if you want to create a custom page with a legacy signup form and force users to go to that page when accessing their account.

**Setup:**
1. Navigate to **Theme Settings** (gear icon in the theme editor)
2. Open the **Account** section
3. Set **Account icon behavior** to **"Redirect"** (this setting only appears when redirect is selected)
4. Enter your custom URL in the **Custom account URL** field

**Note:** The Custom account URL setting only appears when "Account icon behavior" is set to "Redirect".

#### Custom login URL

You can specify a custom URL for login and signup pages in **Theme Settings > Account**. This is helpful if you want to create a custom page with the legacy signup form and force users to go to that page when signing up.

**Setup:**
1. Navigate to **Theme Settings** (gear icon in the theme editor)
2. Open the **Account** section
3. Enter your custom URL in the **Custom login URL** field

**Important:** This URL will override the default login and signup forms throughout the theme, including in the header, footer, menu, product pages, blog items, and product grids.
