### Border settings

| Setting        | Description                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Button radius  | Controls the corner rounding for buttons. Lower values create sharper corners while higher values make buttons more rounded.        |
| Input radius   | Sets the corner rounding for form fields. A value of 5px is recommended for a friendly but clean look.                              |
| Element radius | Controls corner rounding for content sections. Set to 0px for sharp edges that create a more modern layout.                         |
| Button width   | Determines the thickness of button borders. Standard is 1px, but can be increased for emphasis or set to 0px for a borderless look. |
| Input width    | Sets the thickness of borders around form fields. A value of 1px is recommended for clean form fields.                              |
| Element width  | Controls the thickness of borders around content sections. Standard is 1px for subtle framing.                                      |

### Helpful tips

* Use consistent radius values (e.g., all 5px) for a harmonious look
* Combine sharp elements (0px) with some rounded components for visual interest
* Thicker borders (2px+) work well for high-contrast designs
* Borderless (0px width) creates a minimalist aesthetic
