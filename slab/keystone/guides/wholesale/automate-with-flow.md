# Automate workflows with Flow

Shopify Flow is a powerful automation tool that can streamline your wholesale operations. Flow allows you to create automated workflows that trigger actions based on events in your store.

### What is Shopify Flow <a href="#what-is-flow" id="what-is-flow"></a>

[Shopify Flow](https://apps.shopify.com/flow) is a free app (available on Shopify Plus) that automates tasks and processes in your store. For wholesale operations, Flow can handle repetitive tasks automatically, saving you time and reducing errors.

### Wholesale automation examples <a href="#examples" id="examples"></a>

#### Automatic wholesale signups

**Trigger:** Customer submits a wholesale registration form  
**Action:** Automatically tag customer with `approved` tag

This eliminates manual customer approval and instantly grants access to restricted content.

#### Tiered pricing based on order history

**Trigger:** Customer reaches a total order value threshold  
**Action:** Apply custom tags for upgraded pricing tier

Reward loyal wholesale customers with better pricing automatically.

#### Inventory alerts for wholesale products

**Trigger:** Wholesale product inventory drops below threshold  
**Action:** Send email notification to store owner

Stay on top of popular wholesale items before they run out.

#### Order approval workflow

**Trigger:** Large order is placed (over certain amount)  
**Action:** Tag order for manual review and notify staff

Ensure high-value wholesale orders are reviewed before fulfillment.

#### Post-purchase follow-ups

**Trigger:** Wholesale order is fulfilled  
**Action:** Send thank you email or request for reorder

Maintain relationships with wholesale customers automatically.

* Shopify Flow is free but requires **Shopify Plus**
* Non-Plus merchants can use third-party automation apps like [Mechanic](https://apps.shopify.com/mechanic) or [Launchpad](https://apps.shopify.com/launchpad)
* Always test workflows with test customers before enabling them
* You can view workflow history to troubleshoot automation issues
