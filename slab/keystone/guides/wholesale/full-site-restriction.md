# Full site restriction

Full site restriction locks down your entire store to only approved customers. This creates a completely private wholesale or members-only experience where unauthorized visitors can only see specific sections you choose to display.

When enabled, unauthorized visitors will not see:

You can choose how restricted content appears to unauthorized visitors:

**Placeholder style**
* Shows a "Login to view" message
* Indicates that content exists but requires login
* Encourages customers to sign up or log in

**Hidden style**
* Completely hides restricted content
* No indication that restricted content exists
* Creates a cleaner experience for unauthorized visitors

### Important notes <a href="#notes" id="notes"></a>

* Full site restriction works with both [tag-based approval](customer-approval.md#tag-based) and [B2B approval](customer-approval.md#b2b)
* Approved customers must be logged in to access the full site
* The homepage can display selected sections to unauthorized visitors
* This feature is ideal for wholesale-only stores or membership sites

Make sure to add a clear sign-up or login section on your homepage so potential wholesale customers know how to request access.
