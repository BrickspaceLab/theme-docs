# Minimum order amount

Setting a minimum order amount prevents customers from checking out unless their cart meets a specified subtotal. This is useful for wholesale stores that require minimum purchase quantities or order values.

***

### Setup minimum order <a href="#setup" id="setup"></a>

1. Open the **Theme Editor** by clicking **Customize** next to your theme
2. Click **Theme Settings** (gear icon near the top left)
3. Scroll down and click **Cart**
4. Find the **Minimum Order Amount** field
5. Enter the minimum amount in cents (e.g., `10000` for $100.00)
6. Click **Save**

### How it works <a href="#how-it-works" id="how-it-works"></a>

When a minimum order amount is set:

* The checkout button is disabled if the cart subtotal is below the minimum
* A message displays informing customers of the minimum required
* Customers can continue shopping to meet the minimum
* Once the minimum is met, the checkout button becomes active

***
