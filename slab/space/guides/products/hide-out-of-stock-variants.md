# Hide out of stock options

Space includes built-in settings to control how unavailable product options are displayed to customers. You can choose to hide them completely or show them as disabled.

***

### Using theme settings

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
Go to **Online Store** > **Themes** > **Customize**
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Click **Theme settings** (gear icon)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Navigate to **Product options**
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Find the **Unavailable indication** setting
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Choose your preferred option:

* **Show as disabled** - Displays unavailable options with a strikethrough (default)
* **When option is not available** - Hides unavailable options completely
* **Do not indicate** - Shows all options as available
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Click **Save**
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

***

### Recommendation

**Show as disabled** is recommended because it:

* Shows customers all available variations
* Clearly indicates what's temporarily unavailable
* Helps customers understand the full product range
* May encourage customers to check back later

**Hide unavailable options** if:

* You want to keep the interface clean
* Unavailable options are permanently discontinued
* You have many options and want to reduce clutter
