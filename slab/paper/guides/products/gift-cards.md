### How to enable gift card recipient form

By default the gift card recipient form is disabled. This means gift cards will be sent to the email address that was used to complete the purchase. If you want to enable the gift card recipient form to let customers send gift cards to another email this can be done in your theme settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
When enabled the recipient form is not required. A customer will still have to check **I want to send this as a gift**. Otherwise the gift card will be sent to the email used to complete the order.
