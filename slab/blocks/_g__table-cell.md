# Table cell

## Overview

A table cell component that creates an individual cell within a layout__table block, providing a container for merchants to add custom content to table structures.

## Block limitations

This is a private block. It is intended for use only within specific parent blocks and should not be added directly to sections.

## Common use cases

- Add blocks inside the cell to create rich content
- When highlighting columns is needed, ensure the table component has proper Alpine.js initialization
- Must be used within a _table-row component

## Child blocks

This block includes the following nested blocks:

- All theme blocks
- App blocks

## Block settings

This block has no configurable settings. All styling and behavior is inherited from the parent table component.
