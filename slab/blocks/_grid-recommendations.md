# Product recommendations


## Overview

A dynamic product recommendations block that displays recommended products in a grid layout. This block uses Alpine.js to asynchronously load product recommendations from Shopify's recommendation engine based on a source product.


## Block limitations

This is a private block. It is intended for use only within specific parent blocks and should not be added directly to sections.


## Common use cases

- Set a source product in block settings before adding to ensure relevant recommendations
- Adjust item count (default: 5) based on your grid layout and available space
- Use tag filtering when you want to show only products from specific collections or categories
- Enable "show products in cart" for cross-sell scenarios, disable for upsell to avoid redundancy
- Configure the nested product card blocks to match your theme's design system
- Consider using responsive visibility options to show different recommendation counts on mobile vs desktop
- The block works best when placed on product pages, cart pages, or thank you pages
