# Slider recommendations


## Block limitations

This is a private block and can only be used within specific parent blocks. It is designed to work exclusively within the [Slider](layout__slider.md) block.


## Overview

A dynamic product recommendations block that displays recommended products in a horizontal slider layout with scroll snap behavior. This block uses Alpine.js to asynchronously load product recommendations from Shopify's recommendation engine based on a source product. Products are displayed as horizontally scrollable cards with configurable widths and support for filtering by tags, cart status, and responsive visibility options.


## Common use cases

- Set a source product in block settings before adding to ensure relevant recommendations
- Adjust item count (default: 5) based on your slider layout and desired scroll behavior
- Configure width_mobile (default: 80vw) and width_desktop (default: 40vw) to control how many items are visible at once
- Use tag filtering when you want to show only products from specific collections or categories
- Enable "show products in cart" for cross-sell scenarios, disable for upsell to avoid redundancy
- The block works best when placed on product pages, cart pages, or thank you pages
- Best suited for contexts where horizontal scrolling is preferred over a static grid layout
