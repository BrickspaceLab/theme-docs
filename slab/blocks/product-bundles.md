# Bundles

## Overview

A product bundle block that lists bundle items from a metafield and allows adding all selected variants to cart at once. Displays bundle products using the c__bundle-item snippet and integrates with the theme's cart functionality to add multiple line items simultaneously.

## Common use cases

- Configure product bundles using the custom.product_bundle metafield (list of products)
- Use gap size settings to control spacing between bundle items based on your design needs
- Configure button colors to match your theme's design system
- Set appropriate padding based on the container context where the bundle block is displayed
- Test bundle functionality with products that have variants to ensure proper selection flow
