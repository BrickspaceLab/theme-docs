# H1 Headings & Accessibility in Space Theme

- The Space theme uses a single H1 tag on each page, reserved for the primary heading.
- For best accessibility and SEO, do not add additional H1 elements in custom sections, banners or app blocks.
- Use H2, H3, and other heading levels for secondary titles.
- Alt text is available for all images in sections and bannersâ€”ensure these fields are filled out for screen readers.
- All Space theme templates are tested with keyboard navigation and screen readers.

> **Accessibility Tip:** To check heading order, use Chrome DevTools or a browser accessibility extension.
