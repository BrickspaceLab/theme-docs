If you're already using automatic discounts. This is a neat little feature to ensure customers are aware of the discounts being applied to their cart. Take your automatic discount URL and append "?dt=Custom+text" to change the content that appears in the popup.

This will display a popup with your discount and the "Custom text" message.
