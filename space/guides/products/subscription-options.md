# Subscription options

Shopify subscriptions can be a bit tricky to setup. This guide will walk you through different options for displaying subscription options on your product page.

#### Using the built-in subscription options

Our Shopify themes come with built in subscription options. We recommend using this approach as you'll have more control over the experience and can customize this with the help of a developer.

However, this may cause complications with your product templates if you've already installed a third-party subscription widget.

* Ensure the third party subscription widget is disabled
* Ensure the product block Options is included on your product template

#### Using third-party subscription options

Disabling the default subscription options is possible if you'd like to stick to using a third-party widget. There a few more steps here.
