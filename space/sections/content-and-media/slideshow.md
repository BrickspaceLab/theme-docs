# Slideshow

### Section overview

The Slideshow section allows you to create a responsive banner slideshow with multiple slides, each containing background images or videos with text overlays.

#### Common Use Cases

* Hero banners on homepage to showcase promotions or collections
* Product announcements with strong visual impact
* Seasonal campaigns or featured content rotations
* Brand storytelling through a sequence of banner slides

#### Usage Tips

* For best results, use high-quality images with good contrast to ensure text overlays remain readable
* Keep text content concise and impactful to maintain visual hierarchy
* Consider mobile users by keeping essential information visible on smaller screens
* Use auto-scroll feature judiciously - slower scroll speeds (5+ seconds) work best for readability
