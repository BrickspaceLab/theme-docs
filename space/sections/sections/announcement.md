# Announcement

### Section overview

The Announcement bar displays text content at the top of the page, with support for multiple announcements that can be cycled automatically or manually.

#### Common use cases

* Communicate store-wide promotions or sales
* Share important shipping or delivery updates
* Announce new product launches
* Display time-sensitive information

#### Usage tips

* Keep content short and concise for optimal readability
* Link to pages for more detailed information rather than cramming text into the announcement
* For mobile devices, ensure text is brief enough to be readable on smaller screens
* When using multiple announcements, set a reasonable delay time so customers can read each message
