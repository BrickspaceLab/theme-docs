# Text highlight

### Section Overview

The Text Highlight section creates interactive text that gradually reveals content as users scroll down the page, with words lighting up sequentially.

#### Common Use Cases

* Creating engaging storytelling experiences that capture user attention
* Highlighting key brand messaging or value propositions in a memorable way
* Building creative landing pages that reward scrolling behavior
* Showcasing testimonials or quotes with visual emphasis

#### Usage Tips

* Keep text concise for maximum impact - shorter content works best with this effect

* Use complementary colors that maintain legibility when words transition from faded to highlighted
* Test on mobile devices to ensure the scrolling experience is smooth across all viewports
