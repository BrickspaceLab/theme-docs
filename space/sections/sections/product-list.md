# Product list

### Section overview

The Product List section displays products from a selected collection as a list of titles, where hovering each title reveals the product's image alongside it.

#### Common Use Cases

* Creating a minimal, elegantly styled product showcase
* Highlighting featured or curated products with hover effects
* Creating interactive product menus with visual feedback
* Presenting collections in a space-efficient way for lookbooks or catalogs

#### Usage Tips

* For the best hover effect experience, use high-quality product images with consistent dimensions
* Keep product titles concise to maintain a clean appearance in list format
* Enable margin settings for better spacing on larger screens
* Consider mobile users' experience where hover effects aren't available
* Adjust image height to ensure images appear correctly sized when revealed
