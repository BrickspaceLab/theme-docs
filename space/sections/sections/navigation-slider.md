# Navigation slider

### Section overview

The Navigation Slider is a horizontal scrolling component similar to Instagram stories that allows users to navigate to different pages or categories with image thumbnails and text labels.

#### Common use cases

* Highlighting key pages or categories for easy navigation
* Creating a visual menu for product collections
* Showcasing featured content or promotions
* Creating story-like navigation for mobile users

#### Usage tips

* Keep headings short and descriptive to avoid text truncation
* Use consistent image sizes and styles for a cohesive look
* Consider mobile users as this component is most effective on smaller screens
* Use high-quality images that look good as circular thumbnails
