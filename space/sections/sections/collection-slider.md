# Collection slider

### Section overview

The Collection slider section allows merchants to showcase products from a selected collection in an interactive horizontal slider format with customizable appearance and behavior.

#### Common use cases

* Highlight featured products or bestsellers on the homepage
* Display related products within collection or product pages
* Create seasonal or promotional product showcases
* Combine product recommendations with custom content blocks

#### Usage tips

* Choose appropriate card widths for both mobile and desktop to ensure products are displayed attractively across devices
* Consider enabling split layout for sections with longer headings or descriptions to prevent overcrowding
* Use the auto-scroll feature sparingly to avoid frustrating users who are trying to browse at their own pace
* For mobile, select wider card widths (8/12 or higher) to ensure products are easily viewable on smaller screens
