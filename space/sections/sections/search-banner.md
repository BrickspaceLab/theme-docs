# Search banner

### Section overview

The Banner Search section displays a visually appealing banner with an integrated search field, allowing users to search your store from a prominent position on your page.

#### Common use cases

* Creating a visually striking search page header
* Highlighting search functionality on collection or category pages
* Adding a prominent search feature to landing pages
* Providing visual context to search results pages

#### Usage tips

* Use high-quality images that contrast well with the text overlay to ensure readability
* Keep the banner height appropriate for the page context - larger for hero sections, smaller for supporting content
* Consider enabling the gradient overlay to improve text visibility over busy background images
* For mobile users, use a dedicated mobile image with simpler composition to maintain usability on smaller screens
