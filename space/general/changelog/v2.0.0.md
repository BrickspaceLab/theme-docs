# v2.0.0

Big, huge, massive update. We’re adding support for the upcoming variant limit increase - which means Space will support up to 2,000 variants per product when Shopify releases this update. We’ve also went through and dialed in a number of settings and features. For example, you now have much more control over how to display color swatches by changing size and styles.
