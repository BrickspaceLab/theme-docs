# v2.2.1

### **Fixes and improvements**

* **Improved product template block positioning**\
  We reworked how blocks are positioned in the product template to ensure more consistent layout behavior and better control across mobile and desktop.
* **Accurate swatch counts on product cards**\
  Fixed an issue where product cards displayed an incorrect number of swatches. Swatch counts now reflect the actual variant options.
* **Correct swatch display with dropdown selectors**\
  Resolved a bug where swatches wouldn’t appear correctly when the product used dropdown-style variant selectors.
* **Updated currency meta tag for multi-market setups**\
  Adjusted the currency meta tag to behave correctly across multi-market stores, improving compatibility with region-specific pricing and SEO expectations.
* **Restored missing blog thumbnails**\
  Fixed an issue where blog post thumbnails failed to display.
* **Header menu alignment fix**\
  Corrected a layout issue that caused the header menu to misalign in certain configurations.
