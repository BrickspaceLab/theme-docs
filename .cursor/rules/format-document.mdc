Your task:

Review and update formatting for this markdown file.

Rules:

- Use sentence case for all headings (i.e., capitalize only the first word and proper nouns).
- Separate all headings from the content above them with four empty lines.
- Include only a single H1 heading at the top of the page.
- Use H3 (###) for all other headings throughout the page.
- If an H3 heading is immediately followed by a bullet list, include a short descriptive sentence between the heading and the list.
- Ensure all sentences end with proper punctuation.
- Format all tables using raw HTML table syntax (not Markdown table syntax).
