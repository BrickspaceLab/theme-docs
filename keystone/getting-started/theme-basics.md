### **Understanding sections, blocks & templates**

Shopify themes are built using a modular structure of sections, blocks, and templates, allowing merchants to customize their storefronts without touching code. Understanding how these components work together is key to building flexible and user-friendly themes.

**Sections**

* Reusable components (e.g., hero banners, featured collections).
* Can be added, removed, or rearranged in the theme editor.

**Blocks**

* Smaller elements within sections (e.g., text boxes, buttons, images).
* Allow for granular customization without coding.

**Templates**

* Define the layout of specific pages (e.g., product, collection, blog).
* Keystone supports custom templates for advanced use cases.
