### Limitations of Quick Add and Quantity Pickers {#quantity-pickers}

**Quantity pickers are not available on product cards/grid by default.** In Keystone, the quantity input appears only on product pages or "Quick View" modals if enabled—not on cards in collection or featured product grids. This is by Shopify and theme design, not a toggle within settings.

If you need quantity pickers on product cards, this requires custom development. For most stores, using the product page/Quick View to set quantities is recommended. Multi-variant and single-variant products show the same behavior.
