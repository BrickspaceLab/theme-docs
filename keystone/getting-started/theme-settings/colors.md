# Colors

Although it's possible to jump into Keystone and start picking colors, we recommend doing a bit of prep work beforehand. This ensures you have a solid idea of the direction of your brand and the colors you want to use.

If you don't already have a set color palette for your brand, it's useful to spend some time deciding on this direction. You can use free color palette generators, such as [Coolors](https://coolors.co/generate), to help with this process.

There are a handful of great resources online that can help guide your color selection process, including

### Understanding your color schemes&#x20;

#### Body and Body Neutral:

* Body is the base color.
* Body Neutral is a blend of the Body color and Primary Accent.
* If the Body color is dark, Accent and Shade can instead be lighter shades of the Body color.

#### Accent 1-3 and Shade 1-3:

* Accent 1-3 represents darker shades of the Body color.
* Shade 1-3 also represents darker shades of the Body color but with slight opacity, making them semi-transparent.
* For example, if the background color is black, Accent 1-3 will be lighter shades rather than darker.

#### Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Colors:

* These colors are directly derived from the color settings.
