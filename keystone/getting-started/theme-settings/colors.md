# Colors

Although it's possible to jump into Keystone and start picking colors, we recommend doing a bit of prep work beforehand. This ensures you have a solid idea of the direction of your brand and the colors you want to use.

If you don't already have a set color palette for your brand, it's useful to spend some time deciding on this direction. You can use free color palette generators, such as [Coolors](https://coolors.co/generate), to help with this process.

There are a handful of great resources online that can help guide your color selection process, including

### Color setting explanation&#x20;

#### Body and Body Neutral:

* Body is the base color.
* Body Neutral is a blend of the Body color and Primary Accent.

#### Accent 1-3 and Shade 1-3:

* Accent 1-3 represents darker shades of the Body color.
* Shade 1-3 also represents darker shades of the Body color but with slight opacity, making them semi-transparent.

#### Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Colors:

* These colors are directly derived from the color settings.

#### Additional Notes:

* If the Body color is dark, Accent and Shade can instead be lighter shades of the Body color.
* For example, if the background color is black, Accent 1-3 will be lighter shades rather than darker.

You can adjust all colors in Keystone using the global color settings. To achieve better results and improve design implementation, it's important to understand how and where each setting applies colors differently.
