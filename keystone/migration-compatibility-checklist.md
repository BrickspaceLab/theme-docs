# Keystone Migration & Compatibility Checklist

1. **Backup your store** before making any theme or app updates.
2. **Check version requirements** for both Shopify and the Keystone themeâ€”run the latest stable versions.
3. **Review installed apps** to ensure they're compatible with new theme features.
4. **Disable conflicting code** from old themes or custom apps.
5. **Test in a duplicate theme** before publishing live changes.
6. **Check visuals and layout** on mobile and desktop.
7. **Contact support** if you run into unexpected issues or errors.

> **Pro tip:** Always stage changes on a non-live theme to avoid impacting your live store.
