# Replacing "Add to cart" for a product

Customize the "Add to Cart" button text for individual products using metafields. Change to action-specific text like:

* "Pre-order"
* "Reserve Now"
* "Get Yours"

#### How to Customize Button Text

1. **Create the Metafield Definition**
   * Go to **Settings > Custom Data > Products**
   * Click **Add Definition**
   * Enter these details:
     * _Name:_ "Button text"
     * _Namespace/key:_ `custom.button_text`
   * Click **Save**
2. **Update Product Button Text**
   * Open the product in Shopify admin
   * Scroll to **Metafields** at bottom
   * Locate the **Button text** field
   * Enter your custom text (e.g., "Pre-order")
   * Click **Save**

_Pro Tip:_

* Use the bulk editor to update multiple products at once
* Keep custom text short (2-3 words max)
* Test different texts to see what converts best

#### Best Practices

* **Be clear:** "Pre-order" instead of vague alternatives
* **Create urgency:** "Buy Now" vs "Add to Cart"
* **Match intent:** "Customize" for configurable products
* **Stay consistent:** Use the same terms across similar products

#### Technical Notes

* Changes appear immediately
* Works with all button types
* Supports special characters
* Can be translated for multilingual stores
