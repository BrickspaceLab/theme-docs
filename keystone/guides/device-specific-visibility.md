# Using device specific visibility

After editing your theme and previewing it across devices, you may find some sections work better on specific devices. For example:

* Sliders often work better on mobile
* Grid sections often work better on desktop

Keystone lets you create device-specific sections to optimize user experience.

#### How to Set Up Device-Specific Sections

1. Open the Theme Editor
   * Click **Customize** next to your theme
2. Create two sections
   * One section for desktop
   * One section for mobile
3. Set mobile display preferences
   * Click into your mobile section
   * Scroll to **Display**
   * Click **Show on mobile only**
4. Set desktop display preferences
   * Click into your desktop section
   * Scroll to **Display**
   * Click **Show on desktop only**
5. Save your changes
   * You now have sections that display exclusively on their intended devices
