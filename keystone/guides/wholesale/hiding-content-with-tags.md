# Setting Up Account Restriction Feature

## Keystone: Hiding prices, products, and content with tags

***

{% hint style="info" %}
**Restriction tags are case sensitive!**

Restriction tags like `approved` are case-sensitive and must match exactly between the theme editor and tag system. For example, if the theme uses `Approved`, the tag must also be `Approved`—`approved` or `APPROVED` won't work.
{% endhint %}
