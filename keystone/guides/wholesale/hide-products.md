# Hide products with tags

Hiding products completely removes them from view for unauthorized visitors. This is useful for wholesale-only products or exclusive items that should only be visible to approved customers.

***

### Setup <a href="#setup" id="setup"></a>

1. Open the **Theme Editor** by clicking **Customize** next to your theme
2. Click **Theme Settings** (gear icon near the top left)
3. Scroll down and click **Account**
4. In the **Hide products with tag** field, enter a tag (e.g., `hide product`)
5. Click **Save**

***

### Add tags to products <a href="#add-tags" id="add-tags"></a>

1. In your Shopify admin, go to **Products**
2. Select the product you want to hide
3. In the **Tags** section, add the exact tag you configured (e.g., `hide product`)
4. Click **Save**

***

### Where products are hidden <a href="#where-hidden" id="where-hidden"></a>

Tagged products will be hidden from:

* Collection pages
* Search results
* Product grids and sliders
* Featured product sections
* Recently viewed products

***

### Important notes <a href="#notes" id="notes"></a>

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Restriction tags are case sensitive!**

Tags must match exactly between the theme settings and your products. For example, if you set `Hide Product` in theme settings, the product tag must also be `Hide Product`—`hide product` or `HIDE PRODUCT` won't work.
