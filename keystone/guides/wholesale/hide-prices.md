# Hide prices with tags

Hiding prices is useful for wholesale or B2B stores where you want to prevent unauthorized visitors from seeing product pricing. Products with the restriction tag will not display prices or an **Add to Cart** button to customers who aren't logged in or approved.

### Add tags to products <a href="#add-tags" id="add-tags"></a>

### Important notes <a href="#notes" id="notes"></a>

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Restriction tags are case sensitive!**

Tags must match exactly between the theme settings and your products. For example, if you set `Hide Price` in theme settings, the product tag must also be `Hide Price`—`hide price` or `HIDE PRICE` won't work.
