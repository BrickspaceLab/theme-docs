# Hide blog posts with tags

Hiding blog posts allows you to create exclusive content for approved wholesale customers. Unauthorized visitors won't be able to view blog posts with the restriction tag.

1. Open the **Theme Editor** by clicking **Customize** next to your theme
2. Click **Theme Settings** (gear icon near the top left)
3. Scroll down and click **Account**
4. In the **Hide blog posts with tag** field, enter a tag (e.g., `hide blog`)
5. Click **Save**

### Add tags to blog posts <a href="#add-tags" id="add-tags"></a>

1. In your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store** > **Blog posts**
2. Select the blog post you want to restrict
3. In the **Tags** section, add the exact tag you configured (e.g., `hide blog`)
4. Click **Save**

### Where blog posts are hidden <a href="#where-hidden" id="where-hidden"></a>

Tagged blog posts will be hidden from:

* Blog listing pages
* Blog post grids
* Search results
* Related posts sections

***

### Important notes <a href="#notes" id="notes"></a>

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Restriction tags are case sensitive!**

Tags must match exactly between the theme settings and your blog posts. For example, if you set `Hide Blog` in theme settings, the blog tag must also be `Hide Blog`—`hide blog` or `HIDE BLOG` won't work.
