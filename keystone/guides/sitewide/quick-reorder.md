# Quick re‑order

Quickly let customers reorder previously purchased products using Shopify’s built‑in Buy Again for New Customer Accounts, or add dedicated reorder buttons with third‑party apps.

{% hint style="info" %}
The built‑in Buy Again button requires Shopify’s New Customer Accounts. Customers sign in with a one‑time code and can reorder from their order history.
{% endhint %}

## Option 1 — Built‑in “Buy Again” (New Customer Accounts)

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Enable New Customer Accounts in Shopify

In Shopify admin, go to **Settings > Customer accounts** and select **New customer accounts**, then click **Save**.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Expose account access in your theme (recommended)

In the theme editor, open **Header** and enable your account link or **Account drawer** so customers can reach their account dashboard easily.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Customer uses “Buy Again”

Customers log in to their account, open a past order, and click **Buy again** to add the previously purchased items to the cart.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Review cart and checkout

Customers can adjust quantities or remove items, then proceed to checkout.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Option 2 — Third‑party apps (reorder buttons on Thank You/Account pages)

Apps like Reorder Hero, Advance Reorder, or Reorderify add one‑click reorder to the order status (Thank You) page and/or the customer account page, often with customization and discount options.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Choose and install an app

From the Shopify App Store, install a reorder app (e.g., Reorder Hero, Advance Reorder, Reorderify).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Configure placement and behavior

In the app settings, enable reorder buttons on the **Thank You page** and/or **Account > Orders**. Configure options like one‑click add‑to‑cart and which line items to include.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Customize design and messaging

Adjust button text, styles, and any incentive or discount (if supported by the app). Ensure it matches your store’s branding.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Test the flow

Place a test order, then verify the reorder button appears and correctly rebuilds the cart from the order.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Tips

- Keep account access visible (header link or account drawer) so customers can find their order history quickly.
- If your catalog changes frequently, verify how your chosen approach handles out‑of‑stock or discontinued items during reorder.
