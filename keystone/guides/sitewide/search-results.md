#### Language Support

**Live search is only supported in certain languages.** When implementing live search functionality, be aware of the following:

* Full predictive search functionality works best with Latin-based languages (English, French, Spanish, etc.)
* Languages using non-Latin scripts (Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, etc.) may experience limited functionality
* Search results may not properly handle diacritical marks in some languages
* Right-to-left (RTL) languages are supported but may require additional styling adjustments
{% endhint %}

#### Types of Search Components

Our themes offer several ways to implement search functionality:

1. **Search Drawer** - A slide-out search drawer with predictive search functionality.
2. **Search Banner** - A prominent search field on a customizable background.
3. **Header Search** - Simple search integration in the header section.

#### Common Features

* Predictive search results
* Search recommendations
* Filtering by resource type (products, collections, articles, pages)
* Customizable appearance

#### Performance Considerations

* Large product catalogs may experience slower search response times
* Search results are limited to a maximum number of items per category
* Mobile devices may have reduced functionality compared to desktop
* Search indexing can take up to 24 hours to reflect new content
