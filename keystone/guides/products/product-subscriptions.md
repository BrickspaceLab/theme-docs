# Subscription options

Shopify subscriptions can be a bit tricky to setup. This guide will walk you through different options for displaying subscription options on your product page.

### Using the built-in subscription options <a href="#h_10340383b3" id="h_10340383b3"></a>

Our Shopify themes come with built in subscription options. We recommend using this approach as you'll have more control over the experience and can customize this with the help of a developer.

However, this may cause complications with your product templates if you've already installed a third-party subscription widget.

* Ensure the third party subscription widget is disabled
* Ensure the product block Options is included on your product template

Disabling the default subscription options is possible if you'd like to stick to using a third-party widget. There a few more steps here.

1. Go to **Online Store** > **Themes** > **Customize**
2. Click the top dropdown > **Products** > **Create template**
3. Label this template 'subscription'
4. On the left hand side, click into the **Product** section
5. Check **Enable default selling plan widget**
6. On the left hand side, click into the **Options** block and click **Remove block**
7. Go into your subscription app and follow instructions to install the subscription widget
8. Assign the 'subscription' product template to all products that have a subscription plan
9. Hit **Save**
