# Image hotspot

### Section overview

The Image hotspot section is a banner-style element that displays interactive hotspot links overlaid on an image. Users can hover or click on these hotspots to view product information or navigate to specific URLs.

#### Common use cases

* Showcase product features with interactive points highlighting specific details
* Create interactive lookbooks where users can shop directly from an image
* Build educational content with clickable points revealing more information
* Display room or space setups with purchasable items marked by hotspots

#### Usage tips

* Use high-quality images with good contrast to ensure hotspots are visible
* Position hotspots strategically to avoid overcrowding and ensure good mobile experience
* Consider the placement of text content relative to hotspots to prevent overlap
* For mobile, limit the number of hotspots as smaller screens make interaction more challenging
* Test different color schemes to ensure hotspots stand out against your background image
