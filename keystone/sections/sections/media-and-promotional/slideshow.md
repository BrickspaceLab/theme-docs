# Slideshow

### Section overview

The Slideshow section allows for the creation of an interactive banner carousel with customizable content slides, supporting both image and video backgrounds with text overlays and navigation controls.

#### Common use cases

* Showcasing multiple promotional banners or announcements in a single space
* Highlighting featured products or collections with eye-catching visuals
* Creating an engaging homepage hero section with multiple messages
* Displaying seasonal campaigns or promotional offers in rotation

#### Usage tips

* Use high-quality images with good contrast to ensure text remains readable
* Keep slide content concise and focused on a single call-to-action per slide
* Consider mobile users by ensuring text remains legible on smaller screens
* Limit the number of slides to 3-4 to maintain user engagement
* When using auto-scroll, set a reasonable delay (5-7 seconds) to allow users to read content
* Test the slideshow on both desktop and mobile to ensure proper responsiveness
