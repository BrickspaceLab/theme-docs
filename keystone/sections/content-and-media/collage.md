# Collage

### Section overview

The Collage grid section creates a flexible grid layout of customizable content cards that can be used to display various types of content with images, videos, text, and buttons.

#### Common use cases

* Creating a product showcase or collection highlights
* Building a features or benefits grid
* Displaying team members or testimonials
* Creating a visual collage of promotional content or announcements

#### Usage tips

* For the best visual balance, use consistent content block heights or intentionally vary them using row span settings
* Customize individual blocks with different background colors to create visual interest
* Consider mobile layout carefully - fewer columns (1-2) work best on smaller screens
* For best performance, optimize images before uploading and use video sparingly
* Use the split layout option when you want a persistent header alongside scrollable content
