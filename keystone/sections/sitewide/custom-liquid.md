# Custom liquid

### Section overview

The Custom liquid section allows developers to add custom Liquid code directly to their Shopify theme pages. It provides complete flexibility for integrating custom functionality, styling, or dynamic content that isn't covered by standard sections.

#### Common use cases

* Displaying dynamic store information like policies, contact details, or announcements
* Adding custom HTML and CSS that requires Liquid variables
* Integrating third-party widgets or code snippets
* Creating custom layouts that utilize Shopify's Liquid objects and filters

#### Usage tips

* Use proper HTML structure within your Liquid code to maintain accessibility
* Test thoroughly on both desktop and mobile to ensure responsive behavior
* Avoid excessive JavaScript that could impact page performance
* Keep complex Liquid logic organized with appropriate comments
* For security reasons, validate any user inputs before displaying them
