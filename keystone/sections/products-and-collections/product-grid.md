# Product grid

### Section Overview

The Product grid section displays a collection of products in a customizable grid layout with optional header content and content blocks. It allows merchants to showcase products with flexible layout options including split-view layouts and grid configurations.

#### Common Use Cases

* Featuring products from a specific collection on homepage or landing pages
* Creating a product showcase with accompanying promotional content
* Building category pages with filterable product displays
* Creating a featured products section with supplementary content blocks

#### Usage Tips

* The split layout option works best when you have compelling header content to display alongside products
* For mobile displays, consider using a single column layout for better product visibility
* Customize grid density based on the size and complexity of your product images
* Use the content block strategically to add context or promotional messaging within the product grid
* Ensure your collection has enough products to fill the grid properly; consider product count settings based on available products
