# Collection list slider

### Section overview

The Collection list slider is a customizable horizontal slider that showcases different product collections through cards. It provides an interactive way for users to browse through various product categories.

#### Common Use Cases

* Highlight different product categories on your homepage
* Showcase featured or seasonal collections
* Create a visually appealing navigation for your store's main product lines
* Display curated collections alongside custom content blocks

#### Usage Tips

* Keep the number of collections reasonable to prevent overwhelming users

* For better performance, optimize collection images before uploading
