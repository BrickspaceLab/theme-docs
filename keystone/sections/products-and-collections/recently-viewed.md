# Recently viewed

### Section overview

The Recent Slider section displays a horizontal carousel of recently viewed products, automatically tracking and showing products a customer has previously viewed during their browsing session.

#### Common use cases

* Creating a personalized shopping experience by showing products the customer has recently viewed
* Encouraging customers to revisit products they showed interest in but didn't purchase
* Improving navigation on product-heavy stores by making it easy to return to items
* Cross-selling complementary products alongside recently viewed items

#### Usage tips

* Place this section on product pages or the cart page to remind customers of items they've viewed
* Use a clear, concise heading like "Recently Viewed" to indicate the section's purpose
* Consider enabling the split layout option on wider pages for better visual hierarchy
* Customize card width settings to control how many products appear at once in the slider

**Mobile responsiveness considerations:**

* The mobile card width setting controls how many products appear on smaller screens
* Mobile users can swipe through the products in the slider
* Navigation arrows automatically appear when content overflows the container width

**Common pitfalls to avoid:**

* Placing too many recent slider sections on a single page
* Setting card widths too small, making product images difficult to see
* Using overly long headings or content that disrupts the visual flow
