# Non-Developer Customization: Common Requests

You don’t have to be a developer. Here’s how to make common UI tweaks, like switching icons or reducing animations, without writing custom code:

## Change Cart or Header Icons (Saga)
- Theme doesn’t support built-in icon swaps. But you can upload a new icon image in Shopify’s “Files,” then reference it by replacing the `src` in your header’s code (Edit code > theme__header.liquid).
- See our example snippet in the advanced themes section, or request a code snippet from support.

## Remove/Reduce Hover Animation
- In Saga, to remove or minimize product card or logo hover animations: open theme editor, look for “hover animation” toggle. If not available, contact support for a CSS override you can copy & paste in the "custom CSS" field.

## Support Policy Note
We’ll provide small customization snippets, but fully custom features may be out of scope. Ask support—we may still help if the request is simple!
