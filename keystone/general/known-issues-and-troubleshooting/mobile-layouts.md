# Mobile Layout & Sizing Troubleshooting (Keystone)

Users sometimes experience unexpected large images or spacing issues in home page or product section on mobile, especially in Keystone/Kindred themes. Here’s how to fix:

## For Theme Owners
- In theme editor, check for "Number of columns on mobile" and "Image ratio" for home/product sections.
- Always use consistent aspect-ratio images. Square (1:1, ex. 2048x2048px) is safest.
- Set focal point for hero images to control crop on mobile.
- Use the theme customizer’s device preview to check.

## Diagnosing Large Home Images
- If images appear huge/cropped, they may not match the section’s required aspect ratio.
- Try swapping for a Shopify free image to check—sometimes source images are the culprit.
