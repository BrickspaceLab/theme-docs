# v2.1.0

### **Major changes**

**Improved customer account visibility controls**\
You can now more clearly control which content is shown or hidden based on a shopper’s account status. This gives you finer control over gated content and member-only experiences. These new visibility controls are available on the Richtext, Collage, and Banner sections.

**Customizable login and signup button**\
A new setting lets you customize the signup button action, allowing you to point it to any URL you need. This makes it easy to route users to external signup flows or custom pages.

**Legacy form section compatibility**\
The legacy form section now displays a simple button that directs users to the new customer account signup form when enabled. This ensures that if a customer encounters a legacy form while using the new customer accounts, the experience still works and sends them to the correct page.

### **Fixes and improvements**

* **Clearer login redirect behavior**\
  Theme settings have been updated to better explain the limitations around login redirects, reducing confusion when customizing customer account flows.
* **Correct account link routing**\
  Fixed an issue where some account links pointed to incorrect destinations. All account-related links now route properly.
* **Adjusted currency meta tag for multi-market setups**\
  Updated the currency meta tag to behave correctly across multi-market stores, improving compatibility with region-specific pricing and SEO expectations.
