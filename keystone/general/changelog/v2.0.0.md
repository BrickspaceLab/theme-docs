# v2.0.0

Lots of improvements here to really fine tune how Keystone handles high variant products. We've introduced new table pagination for variant rows and let you control how this is setup now.&#x20;



**Added**

* Add new settings to change how variant tables are loaded. Merchants now have the ability to load with no variant rows loaded improving page performance when many variants are available.&#x20;
* Add new pagination to variant tables so merchants can load 50 variant rows at a time.
* Add improved pagination when returning to an infinite scrolled collection page. For example, if you scroll down to the 4th page click a link then navigate back you'll be brought to the 4th page instead of previously going back to the 1st page.&#x20;



**Fixes and improvements**

* Improvements to better support high variant products
* Fix pagination from breaking after using filters
* Fix discounts breaking cart checkout with specific apps
* Fix quantity selectors not respecting stock count
* Fix pickup block not being shown when variant preselected
* Fix combined listing selection being unselected
