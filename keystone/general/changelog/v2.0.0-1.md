# v2.0.1

### Major changes

**Edit themes while restrictions are enabled**\
We added a new editor condition that allows you to make theme changes even when site restrictions are turned on (for example during password protection or maintenance mode). This removes unnecessary blockers and improves admin workflows.

**Direct links for Variant Tables**\
Variant table selections now deep-link directly to the preselected variant. Shoppers are taken straight to the exact variant they chose, reducing extra clicks and friction on the product page.

### Fixes and improvements

* **Sticky Buy Button reliability**\
  Fixed an issue where the Sticky Buy Button could fail to add items to cart, ensuring consistent add-to-cart behavior.
* **Mobile sub-collection grid**\
  Resolved overflow issues on small viewports so grids now render cleanly across mobile devices.
* **Subtag menu highlighting**\
  Corrected a bug where multiple labels with matching prefixes could appear highlighted at the same time.
* **Featured Product rendering**\
  Fixed layout and display issues affecting the Featured Product section so it now renders as intended across themes and breakpoints.
