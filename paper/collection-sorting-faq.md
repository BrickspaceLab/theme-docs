# Collection Sorting in the Paper Theme

In Paper, collections are sorted based on the rules set in your Shopify admin. You can control the default sort order (Best selling, Alphabetical, Price, etc) for each collection in Shopify > Products > Collections > [Your Collection] > Sort.

If you want to show a custom sort (e.g. by metafield, vendor, tag, or manual arrangement), use Shopify's built-in sort tools. The Paper theme respects the order set in the Shopify admin.

> **Tip:** Refresh your storefront after updating sorting in admin to see changes reflected in Paper.
