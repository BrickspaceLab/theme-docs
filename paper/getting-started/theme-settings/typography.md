# Typography

Text plays a significant role on your website. Both the content and the typography you use are crucial for building a strong visual identity that resonates with customers.

Editing font family

We suggest using a maximum of two different fonts to avoid impacting your website's performance. Consider using the same font for two settings.

System fonts are recommended if you prioritize speed over visual consistency.

* Body font: Applied to main body text across your site, such as description text and other content.
* Heading font: Applied to all headings on your site.
* Navigation font: Applied to all buttons.
* Base size: The smallest font size, serving as a reference for all other font sizes, including headings.

Editing type settings

Type settings can be used to further customize which fonts are used throughout your theme. These settings can be used to change capitalization and font families.
