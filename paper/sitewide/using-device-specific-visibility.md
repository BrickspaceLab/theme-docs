# Using device specific visibility

After editing your theme and previewing it across different devices you may find that some sections just look better on some devices. For example on mobile devices you may want to use a slider instead of a grid section.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Scroll down to **Display** then click either **Show on mobile only** or **Show on desktop only**


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
