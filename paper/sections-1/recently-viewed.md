# Recently viewed

### Section overview

This section displays a horizontal slider of products that customers have recently viewed while browsing the store. It helps customers revisit items they've shown interest in, potentially increasing conversion rates.

#### Common use cases

* Display recently viewed products on product pages to encourage customers to return to items they browsed
* Add to cart pages to promote additional purchases
* Include on homepage for returning visitors to quickly access products they previously viewed
* Use on collection pages to remind customers of products they've already seen

#### Usage tips

* Place this section strategically where customers might need a reminder of products they've viewed
* Consider limiting the section to display only on product or cart pages for most relevance
* Ensure the section's heading clearly communicates its purpose (e.g., "Recently viewed")
* For mobile optimization, the section automatically adjusts to a narrower display with appropriate spacing
* The section only displays when customers have viewed products, avoiding empty space for new visitors
