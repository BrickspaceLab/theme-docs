# Navigation slider

### Section overview

The Navigation Slider section provides a horizontal scrollable carousel of circular images with text captions, similar to Instagram stories. It creates an interactive and visually appealing way to showcase navigation links throughout your store.

#### Common use cases

* Highlighting featured product categories or collections
* Creating quick-access navigation to important store pages
* Showcasing featured brands or designers
* Displaying promotional campaigns or seasonal content

#### Usage tips

* Use consistent image styles (preferably square images) for a uniform appearance
* Keep heading text short and concise for better mobile display
* Add 5-10 slides for optimal user experience without overwhelming visitors
* Consider using this section near the top of your homepage or collection pages for maximum visibility

Mobile responsiveness considerations:

* Images remain centered and properly sized on smaller screens
* The section employs smooth scrolling and snap positioning for better mobile interaction
* You can set the section to appear only on mobile or desktop if needed
