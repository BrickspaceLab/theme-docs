# Icon grid

### Section overview

The Icon Grid section displays a customizable grid of icon cards with headings and descriptive content. It allows for flexible layout options with control over colors, spacing, and responsive behavior.

#### Common use cases

* Showcase product features or benefits with icons and descriptions
* Display service offerings or company values
* Create a grid of informational content cards with visual elements
* Highlight key selling points or unique value propositions

#### Usage tips

* Use consistently sized icons (ideally SVGs) for a polished appearance
* Keep headings concise and content brief for better readability
