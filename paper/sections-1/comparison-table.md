# Comparison table

### Section overview

The Comparison Table section creates a responsive, customizable table for comparing product features, services, or brand offerings across multiple columns. It provides a clear visual representation of differences between items.

#### Common use cases

* Product feature comparisons to highlight advantages over competitors
* Service tier comparisons (basic vs premium vs enterprise)
* Subscription plan comparisons to showcase different pricing tiers
* Specification comparisons between related products

#### Usage tips

* Keep feature labels in the first column clear and concise
* Use consistent formatting across all columns for better readability
* Consider highlighting your primary offering with column borders
* Include tooltips for complex features that need additional explanation
* Use icons strategically to visually reinforce information

**Mobile responsiveness considerations**

* The table automatically adapts to a stacked layout on mobile devices
* Column headers become hidden on mobile and are shown inline with values
* Consider how many columns you include, as more columns create more scrolling on mobile
