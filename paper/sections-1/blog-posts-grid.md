# Blog posts grid

### Section overview

The Blog posts grid section displays a customizable grid of blog articles, allowing merchants to showcase recent or featured content from their blog.

#### Common use cases

* Highlighting recent blog posts on the homepage
* Featuring selected articles in a dedicated section on any page
* Creating a curated reading list of related content
* Displaying news or updates in a visually appealing grid format

#### Usage tips

* Keep the article count balanced with your layout - 3 articles works well for most designs
* Use a clear, concise heading that describes the content (e.g., "Latest Updates" or "Featured Articles")
* Consider mobile display - content stacks differently on smaller screens
* Ensure your article featured images are consistent in size and style for a cohesive look
