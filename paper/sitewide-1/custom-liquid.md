# Custom liquid

### Section overview

The Liquid section serves as a flexible container that enables developers to inject custom Liquid code directly into a Shopify theme.

#### Common use cases

* Display dynamic shop information like store name, policies, or announcements
* Integrate third-party widgets or scripts
* Create custom HTML/CSS structures that aren't available through standard sections
* Implement complex conditional logic based on template conditions

#### Usage tips

* Always test your Liquid code thoroughly before deploying to production
* Use the section's color scheme settings to maintain visual consistency with your theme
* Consider mobile visibility settings when adding content that might not display well on smaller screens
* Keep your Liquid code clean and commented for easier maintenance
* Leverage the built-in padding controls to maintain proper spacing within your layout
