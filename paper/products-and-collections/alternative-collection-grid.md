# Alternative collection grid

### Section overview

The Product Featured section displays a grid of highlighted products from a collection, each showcasing multiple product images in an attractive layout.

#### Common use cases

* Featured collections showcase on homepage
* Highlighting products with rich imagery (products with multiple photos)
* Creating visually appealing product displays that draw attention
* Promotional sections highlighting seasonal or special products

#### Usage tips

* **Best practices:**
  * Ensure selected products have at least 4 product photos for optimal display
  * Use this section for products with high-quality images to maximize visual impact
  * Add a compelling heading and description to provide context
  * Include a call-to-action button to direct customers to the full collection
* **Common pitfalls:**
  * Using products with fewer than 4 images will result in duplicated images in the grid
  * Overcrowding the page with too many products (3-4 products is usually optimal)
  * Not customizing the heading and content to match your promotional intent
* **Mobile responsiveness:**
  * Configure appropriate row size settings for mobile displays
  * Consider using a single column layout on mobile for better product visibility
  * Test how the multi-image layout appears on smaller screens
