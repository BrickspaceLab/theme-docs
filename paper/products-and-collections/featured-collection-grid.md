# Featured collection grid

### Section overview

The Featured collection grid section displays a collection of products in a responsive grid layout with customizable appearance and content. It can also include an optional content card.

#### Common use cases

* Building custom product showcases with mixed content

#### Usage tips

* Choose the right number of products to display based on your page layout
* Select appropriate grid sizes for desktop and mobile to maintain visual appeal
