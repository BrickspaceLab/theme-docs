# Countdown

### Section overview

The Countdown section provides a dynamic timer that counts down to a specific date, perfect for creating urgency around limited-time offers, promotions, or events on your Shopify store.

#### Common use cases

* Highlight time-limited sales or promotions
* Create urgency for product launches or pre-orders
* Display countdown to seasonal events or holidays
* Showcase limited availability for exclusive products

#### Usage tips

* Set a realistic countdown date that aligns with your marketing campaigns
* Use clear, action-oriented text that explains what happens when the countdown ends
* Include a call-to-action button that directs customers to the relevant offer or collection
* For mobile responsiveness, adjust the width settings for mobile displays to ensure the countdown timer remains legible on smaller screens
* Avoid setting countdowns too far in advance as this may reduce the sense of urgency
* If using an image alongside the countdown, ensure it visually reinforces the promotion's message
