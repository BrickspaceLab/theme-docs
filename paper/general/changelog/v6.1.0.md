# v6.1.0

Happy September! A lot of exciting stuff for you in this update!

We have done a lot of work optimizing how images are rendered in the theme and were able to see some real performance gains! We have also reworked how variant specific image setting works. Now you don't have to go through each image and edit the alt tag. Instead, you just order the images and our theme will figure out which images to show. Also bug fixes, as always.
